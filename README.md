## UX:

FindRoommate was built using Mongoose, React, and Express with the user's experience in mind.
Users can expect an aesthetic and simple experience while using FindRoommate. 
Examples of this are our dropdown menus, streamlined offer postings, simple login page, and options in case a user loses their login.

# Homepage

On our homepage, users can right away search for their ideal housing needs or post there housing opportunities for others.
